A simple web app to exercise my skills in using different software and java programming tools.

The webapp is a simple e-commerce store.



Some skills and tools I want to utilize in this project are:

1. Logging - using slf4j and/or log4j

2. Build tools - Maven and/or Ant

3. Servlets and JSPs

4. JDBC

5. Cloud development and deployment (cloudbees and codenvy)

6. Web technologies - (HTML, CSS , JavaScript, JQuery, DOJO Toolkit)

7. Of course, Git


Eventually, I plan to recreate the same project (i don't know if fork is the proper term),
but using frameworks and other more advanced technologies. The following list are some of
the technologies/frameworks i have in mind. but i may add (or remove) some as i gain more
experience.

1. Spring

2. Hibernate

3. JasperReports
